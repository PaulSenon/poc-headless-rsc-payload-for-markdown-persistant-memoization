# Important rules

In all interactions, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
When assuming something not based on online verified proof, rate confidence score in % first, and if bellow 95%, you must verify using doc, web, anything external, and trust only good sources.
Use context7 to fetch doc before using any library or doing important refactoring.
When installing dependencies, use pnpm commands, and NEVER manully edit package.json by any means.
When installing shared dependencies in the monorepo, use `pnpm add myDependecy --save-catalog` (every time whanting to install this depsn in any sub project, use this command).
